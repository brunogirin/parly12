Rewired State Parliament 2012 Hack
==================================

The Brief
---------

This is a simple [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) application
created for [Rewired State Parliament 2012](http://rewiredstate.org/hacks/parliament-2012)
that generates graphs from voting behavour by British Members of Parliament
held in a database. I worked with
[Charlie Perrins](http://twitter.com/charlieperrins) who came up with the
original idea and collated all source data; and
[Ela Osterberger](http://twitter.com/CuteNumbers) who did some brilliant
analytics work. Full details and a presentation of the hack
[are available](http://hacks.rewiredstate.org/events/parlyhack-2012/mps-legislative-rainy-day-fun-pack).

Take Away
---------

As ever with with hack days, there was the opportunity to learn new things,
some of those are implemented in the code:
* How to [execute custom SQL in django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/sql/#executing-custom-sql-directly);
* How to [create inline SVG in HTML5](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_svg.asp)
and generate it in a django template.

The hack does interesting stuff but is limited by the fact that the data is
held in a SQL database. More interesting graphs could probably be generated by
using a no-SQL database such as [riak](http://wiki.basho.com/) or by using
a statistical language such as [R](http://www.r-project.org/), which were
investigated but discarded as too complicated due to time constraints:
* How to [embed R code in python](http://rpy.sourceforge.net/);
* How to [call Riak from django](https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client).
