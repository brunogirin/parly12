        <h1>Rewired State Parliament 2012 Hack</h1>

<h2>The Brief</h2>

<p>This is a simple <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a> application
created for <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/hacks/parliament-2012">Rewired State Parliament 2012</a>
that generates graphs from voting behaviour by British Members of Parliament
held in a database. I worked with
<a href="http://twitter.com/charlieperrins">Charlie Perrins</a> who came up with the
original idea and collated all source data; and
<a href="http://twitter.com/CuteNumbers">Ela Osterberger</a> who did some brilliant
analytics work. Full details and a presentation of the hack
<a href="http://hacks.rewiredstate.org/events/parlyhack-2012/mps-legislative-rainy-day-fun-pack">are available on the Rewired State hack page</a>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>In order to run the application, unpack everything, install django then
navigate to the <code>parly2012</code> directory in a terminal and run the following:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir ../static
./manage.py collectstatic
./manage.py syncdb
./manage.py runserver
</code></pre>

<p>This will start a lightweight web server that you will be able to access at
the following URL: <a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a></p>

<p>You will first be presented with a page that asks you to load the data set.
Note that loading the full data set takes quite a long time.</p>

<h2>Technical Tricks</h2>

<p>As ever with with hack days, there was the opportunity to learn new things,
some of those are implemented in the code:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/sql/#executing-custom-sql-directly">execute custom SQL in django</a>;</li>
<li>How to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_svg.asp">create inline SVG in HTML5</a>
and generate it in a django template.</li>
</ul><p>The hack does interesting stuff but is limited by the fact that the data is
held in a SQL database. More interesting graphs could probably be generated by
using a no-SQL database such as <a href="http://wiki.basho.com/">riak</a> or by using
a statistical language such as <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, which were
investigated but discarded as too complicated due to time constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to <a href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net/">embed R code in python</a>;</li>
<li>How to <a href="https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client">call Riak in python</a>.</li>
